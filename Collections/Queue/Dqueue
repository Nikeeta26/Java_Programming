Deque (Double-Ended Queue):
A deque (double-ended queue) is a generalized version of a queue where
elements can be added or removed from both the front and the rear.

It does not follow a strict FIFO principle because it allows both enqueue 
and dequeue operations from either end.

Deque can be used as both a queue (FIFO) and a stack (LIFO), offering more flexibility.


import java.util.ArrayDeque;
import java.util.Deque;

public class DequeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Deque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();

        deque.offerFirst(10); // Add to front
        deque.offerLast(20);  // Add to rear
        deque.offerFirst(5);  // Add to front

        System.out.println("Deque: " + deque);

        deque.pollFirst();    // Remove from front
        deque.pollLast();     // Remove from rear

        System.out.println("Deque after removal: " + deque);
    }
}
