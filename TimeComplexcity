Time complexcity:
      relation between i/p size and rumming time(opration).

    Time complexcity is directly proposion to i/p n;
Type:
1: Best Case
Ex:
    1 2 3 4 5;
    find 1?
       1 in first position.

2:Average Case
Ex:
   5 6 4 2 1 3;
     find 1?
       1+2+3+4+5+6 / 6; (addition of total no/ total no)

    (n+1)/n;

3:Worst Case
