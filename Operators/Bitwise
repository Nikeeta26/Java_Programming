^(XOR)  => 00=0, 11=0, 10=1

~(complements)

<<(left shift):
    0101 => 1010
    
>>(right shift)
     1010 => 0101



Ex:
  get no. of 3rd (position 2) of the no. n (n=0101);

  bit mask : 1<<i
  operation AND
                    1. 1<<2 = 0100;

                    2. 0100 + 0101

                     = 0100
            no. is 1.
