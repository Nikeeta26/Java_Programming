 It is used to achieve abstraction.
 By interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.

interface test
{
    abstract void payment();
}
class sample implements InterfaceExample
{
    public vois payment(){
        System.out.println("this is interface");
    }

public static void main(String args[])
    {
    sample s = new sample();
    s.payment();
    }
}
