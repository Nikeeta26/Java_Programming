//Abstraction 

 Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation
details and showing only functionality to the user.

 Another way, it shows only essential things to the user and
hides the internal details.

 We can achieve Abstraction by using ABSTRACT CLASS and
INTERFACE.

 EX. Sms ,ATM, Cell phone.


 An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
 It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
 It cannot be instantiated.
 It can have constructors and static methods also.
 It can have final methods


abstract class demo
 {
 
 abstract void payment();

 }

 class wallet extends demo{
 void payment() 
{
 System.out.println("Wallet payment success");
 }

 }

 class netbanking extends demo{
 void payment()
 {
 System.out.println("Netbanking payment success");
 }
 }

class AbstractionExaomple1
 { 
public static void main(String args[])
 {  
    
wallet w=new wallet();
 w.payment();

 netbanking n=new netbanking();
 n.payment();

 }  
}
